2.7.6p1 (16-Mar-2021)
 -> URL fixes: {http://www.wendzel.de/?sub=.*} -> http://www.wendzel.de/...
 -> Some typo fixes -- I just couldn't leave this untouched anymore. So there
    is this typo-fixed release 12 years after the last one. Probably, it will
    be the last astrocam release, ever! :)

2.7.6 (26-May-2009)
 MISC:
  -> install.sh: don't check for /var/www/apache2-default since /var/www
     should be enough
  -> URL fixes: {http://wendzel.de.*} -> {http://www.wendzel.de.*}
  -> INSTALL: some tiny typo fixes in the installation documentation file

2.7.5 (07-Oct-2008) (the just-a-few-updates release)
 ADDED FEATURES:
  -> added acam_console.pl, a test program that helps to check if the
     basic movement of the engine works
 MISC:
  -> Updated the manpage file astrocam.7
  -> tiny documentation typo fix
  -> install.sh now finds /var/www too while searching for a htdocs
     target location

2.7.4 (02-May-2008) (the you-should-upgrade release)
 FIXES:
  -> security fix: check values in pic.php to prevent scripting attacks.
     See BUGS file for details.
  -> bugfix: astrocam.php now checks if all of the needed values in
     astrocam.conf are set
  -> bugfix: use 'contenturl' config value for spacer.gif too
 MISC:
  -> the refresh time of the webcam picture can now configured by the value
     "refreshtime" in astrocam.conf

 MISC:
  -> Improved the INSTALL file documentation a little bit
  -> Updated the website URLs

2.7.2 (23-12-2007) (the XMAS-release-2007)
 MISC:
  -> Removed astrocam.h. The I/O address of the parallel port can now be set
     by the 'iobase' value in /etc/astrocam.conf.
  -> use a 2 sec refresh time instead of a 5 sec refresh time

2.7.1 (19-05-2007)
 MISC:
  -> Add support for the directories of the myserver web-server software
     in installer.sh

2.7.0 (01-05-2007)
 ADDED FEATURES:
  -> add the new perl based webinterface as additional choice. nobody _has
     to_ but everybody _can_ still use the PHP webinterface.
  -> add new version 2.0 installer (including documentation installer and
     support for multiple man/doc/www/cgi-bin paths)
  -> add new contenturl var in astrocam.conf to make it easy for the user
     to set the location of the .css files and such
 MISC:
  -> improve the documentation in the INSTALL file
  -> improve error msgs in astrocam.php a little bit
  -> removed error counting code since nobody needs that
  -> removed 'visual' var from astrocam.conf
  -> use /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh in the Makefile to execute install.sh
     and in install.sh itself
  -> some code cleanup

2.6.6 (09-Mar-2007)
 FIXES:
  -> don't exit if we received too much data via message queue. only reject
     the data. this prevents DoS attacks that can cause astrocam to exit!
 MISC:
  -> small improvements in the manpage (astrocam.7)
  -> add missing <body> tag in astrocam.php
  -> make it possible to run with the perl webinterface

2.6.5 (28-Feb-2007)
  -> install.sh: made the UID-question easier: s/id|awk ...|sed .../id -u/
  -> install.sh: do not clean up. if something went wrong we need to re-
     compile. and this sux. also check if the hand given $MANPATH does
     exist before cp'ing astrocam.7 to it.
  -> astrocam.c: check the linux version by macros and include the needed
     header file.
  -> astrocam.c: do not allocate mem for buf[] in restart_ac() because we
     don't need dyn mem
  -> astrocam.c: check if the pid file is a symlink to prevent symlink attks
  -> astrocam.c: check if others/group has write access to the pid file
  -> astrocam.c: check if the pid file isn't owned by root
  -> astrocam.c: do not set exec bit for pid file by default. this isn't
     needed.
  -> astrocam.h: remove linux version stuff: The user does not have to set
     his linux version in the header file by hand from now on.
  -> astrocam.php: exit when we cannot open /etc/astrocam.conf
  -> astrocam.php: exit when we cannot send data trough the message queue
  -> astrocam.php: code cleanup
  -> astrocam.php: use a smaller font for the line "astrocam webinterface"
  -> astrocam.php: improve the error messages a little bit
  -> INSTALL file: improve the documentation

2.6.4 (09-Nov-2006)
  -> removed unneded var 'i' in main()
  -> global CONFIG_FILE macro in astrocams C code
  -> removed layout.php
  -> implemented two new values in astrocam.conf:
  	imagesize-x and imagesize-y.
     This values specify the width and height of the webcam image
     displayed in astrocam.php.
  -> removed some german output for debug compiling in astrocam.c

2.6.3 (18-Aug-2006)
  -> fixed config file reading code: it was possibly to create a
     buffer overflow there.
  -> implemented errbuf bzero() call. this wasn't needed but it's
     better to have it in future
  -> implement chmod 700 for the PIDFILE using fchmod()
  -> little documentation add-on
  -> removed the \n in the welcome message
  -> solved a problem with the manpage path under some linux
     distributions in the install.sh script. Now it will check
     for the two most common man path's. If both paths are not
     there, the user can enter his path manually.

2.6.2 (14-May-2006)
  -> removed the print_info() function in astrocam.php because of
     security reasons. Nobody should be able to scann the underlying
     operating system. why did I just implement such a code!?
  -> small manpage update
  -> running bzero over configuration struct in astrocam.c to prevent
     stupid gcc compiler warnings
  -> improved error messages
  -> code compiled under linux-2.6.12. I hope, 2.6.x kernels are now
     fully supported

2.6.1 (01-Aug-2005)
  -> removed unneded code from the install-script
  -> thought that there was a extremely important bug.
     but there was none :}

2.5.9 (11-Nov-2004)
  -> removed some unneded lines of code
  -> manpage update; manpage section moved from 8 (sysadm) to 7 (misc)
  -> grammar fix in manpage, hope it's correct now :-[
  -> set linux-2.4 (and newer) defines as default. this makes the install
     process a little bit easier (changings are only needed on 2.2-kernels).

2.5.8p2 (16-Jun-2004)
  -> including astrocam.h before including "LINUX"

2.5.8p1 (07-May-2004) [editor note: this wasn't a bug]
